I've developed a compact version of an AIRBNB CLONE entirely from scratch using React Native. Employing the latest tech stack, this app showcases cutting-edge innovations in mobile development.

Here's what you will get from this app:

- ✅ Expo file-based routing for smooth navigation.
- ✅ Clerk for robust user authentication, ensuring top-notch security.
- ✅ Sign in with Apple and Google Auth for unparalleled user convenience and versatility.
- ✅ Animations using Reanimated.
- ✅ Parallax effect
- ✅ Bottom Sheet feature for intuitive content display and navigation.
- ✅ Dynamic maps and clustering for efficient data visualization and exploration.
